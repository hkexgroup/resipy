GUI in animated GIF
========================
On this page you will find several example of what can be done with the GUI as short animated GIF.


.. _importing:
.. figure:: image/Inv_import.gif

    Importing data. Different parsers are available. DC and IP data can be imported. A custom parser allows to parse in any file type.


.. _meshTopo:
.. figure:: image/mesh.gif

    Creating a mesh (quadrilateral or triangular). Assigning regions of different shapes. Those regions can be fixed, be part of different zones (a zone is a region with a sharp boundary), have a specific starting resistivity and phase value. 


.. _mesh:
.. figure:: image/Inv_Mesh.gif

    When topography is supplied the quadrilateral and triangular mesh takes it into account automatically.


.. _preproc:
.. figure:: image/Inv_PreProc.gif

    Data pre-processing for DC data. Data can be filtered manually by selecting bad quadrupoles or/and specific electrodes. A resistance error model can then be fitted.
    
    
.. _timelapse:
.. figure:: image/Inv_TimeLapse.gif

    Time-Lapse processing and inversion.
    
    
.. _:xbh
.. figure:: image/Inv_XBH.gif

    Inversion of cross-borehole data.
   

.. _phaseFilt:
.. figure:: image/phaseFilt.gif

    Filtering of IP (Phase) data using vmin/vmax, DCA filtering and other tools.
    

.. _recipFilt:
.. figure:: image/recipFilt.gif

    Filtering based on reciprocal error.
    
    
.. _inversion:
.. figure:: image/Inv_Inversion.gif

    Inversion settings as well as results displayed.
    
    
.. _forward:
.. figure:: image/Forward.gif

    Forward modelling on a flat surface.
    
    
.. _forwardTopo:
.. figure:: image/Forward_topo.gif

    Forward modelling with topography.
