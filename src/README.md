ResIPy a python wrapper around R2 codes
=======================================

This python wrapper around the R2 family of codes (http://www.es.lancs.ac.uk/people/amb/Freeware/R2/R2.htm)
provides a python API (Application Programming Interface) for inverting resistivity and IP data.

It aims to be 
- (1) **simple and intuitive** to use (you can invert your data in one-click with all default settings)
- (2) but still allowing the user to have **full control** on data filtering, error modelling, mesh parameters and inversion settings

This is an open-source project, everyone is welcome to contribute.

In addition to this python package that provideds the API,
a multi-platform standalone Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also available to download.

Please see the gitlab repository for more information and to download the executable for the GUI: **https://gitlab.com/hkex/pyr2**
